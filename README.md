My very first Git repository.

{
  This is to track my progress against the Advent Of Code, practicing Git.
  As you can't see, I am using Microsoft Excel to solve these challenges whilst programming.
  Using as much C++ as possible and less pure C (completely opposed to what I'm used to), I'm hoping to learn what I've been missing about modern C++.
}

We'll see how far I get.

Cheers.
